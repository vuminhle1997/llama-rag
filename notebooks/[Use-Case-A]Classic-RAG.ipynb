    "# Use Case A: Context-Intensive Question Answering with Classic RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a practical use case for **classic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** in the form of a context-rich, interactive question-answering (Q&A) session between users and an LLM-driven agent. The central goal is to showcase how an agent can handle complex, multi-turn user queries by retrieving and reasoning over semantically relevant context from documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG system integrates the following key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Large Language Model (LLM)** and **Embedding Model** provided by the **IONOS AI Hub**, executed locally via the Ollama infrastructure.\n",
    "- **ChromaDB** as the vector database for storing and querying semantically meaningful chunks.\n",
    "- Two distinct **chunking strategies**:\n",
    "  - *Default Chunking* using standard parameters (e.g., ~1024 tokens)\n",
    "  - *Fine-Grained Chunking* using smaller window sizes for improved context separation\n",
    "- A **ReAct-style agent** (Reasoning + Acting), which dynamically decides when to retrieve context and when to generate responses.\n",
    "- **Asynchronous response handling**, enabling near real-time interactive dialogue with users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Use Case Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This use case simulates a **multi-turn dialogue** between a user and the system, where the agent must reason across context-rich documents and retrieve relevant passages as needed. The system maintains dialogue coherence, handles follow-up questions, and provides grounded responses. The interaction is designed to be **interactive and adaptive**, mimicking real-world enterprise or expert system use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📄 Loading and Preparing the Transcription File\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we load a `.txt` file containing a full transcription of a real-world conversation or dialogue. This file will serve as the primary data source for retrieval in our RAG pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "📂 **File Path:** `./data/[Use-Case-A]Transcription.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "The transcription typically includes turn-based exchanges between users and subject matter experts. It is used to simulate a context-intensive dialogue scenario, such as a support session, interview, or internal consultation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps performed here:\n",
    "- Load the raw transcription from the file system.\n",
    "- (Optional) Apply preprocessing such as removing speaker tags, timestamps, or unnecessary line breaks.\n",
    "- Prepare the cleaned text for downstream chunking and semantic indexing in ChromaDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "This file forms the knowledge base from which the agent will retrieve context to answer user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔬 Technical Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ReAct prompting** empowers the agent to interleave retrieval steps and reasoning dynamically, improving response accuracy.\n",
    "- **Chunking comparison** allows evaluation of how chunk size and granularity impact retrieval precision and answer quality.\n",
    "- **Async response streaming** facilitates fast, responsive UX for user interaction, particularly when embedded in applications or chat interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook proceeds by incrementally setting up each component—starting with model initialization, data ingestion, chunking, indexing, and finally executing queries against the RAG system while comparing results across chunking strategies.\n"
