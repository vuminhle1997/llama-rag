Um die Frage zu beantworten, wann die meisten Pässe abgerufen werden, muss ich mich auf die Spalten konzentrieren, die mit Zeit und Abruf von Pässen zusammenhängen. Die `passid`-Tabelle hat Spalten wie `created_at`, `timestamp`, `tobekilled`, `deactivated` und `killtime`, die alle mit Zeit und Status von Pässen zu tun haben. Die `ForwardExposee`-Tabelle hat Spalten wie `element_id` und `projectno`, die möglicherweise mit der Identifizierung von Pässen oder Projekten zusammenhängen. Die `external_passes`-Tabelle hat nur eine Spalte `pass_url`, die möglicherweise mit dem Abruf von Pässen zusammenhängt.\n",
